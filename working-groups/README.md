# LF AI & Data Foundation Working Groups
A working group (WG) under the Technical Advisory Council (TAC) is a group with a shared interest in advancing a specific area of knowledge, learning, or technology related to the mission of the Foundation where members cooperate to affect or to produce solutions within a specific area. A WG can be created by anyone in the Foundation community and must be proposed to and approved by the TAC or requested by the Governing Board.

Working groups are open to the community.  Working groups can choose to manage their projects either in GitHub or in the [LF AI & Data Confluence](https://lf-aidata.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DL/overview?mode=global)
