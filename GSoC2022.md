# Project ideas for GSoC 2022

## The FEAST project

- **Name:** Feast - Feature Store for Machine Learning
- **Homepage:** https://feast.dev/
- **GitHub:** https://github.com/feast-dev/feast

### Project idea #1: Real-time Observability

**Time:** 350 hr = 8 weeks

**Potential Mentors:**

- [Oleksii Moskalenko](https://github.com/pyalex)
- [Felix Wang](https://github.com/felixwang9817)
- [Willem Pienaar](https://github.com/woop)

**Prerequisites:**

- Python
- Go
- Nice to have: familiarity with cloud infrastructure and monitoring tools (Kubernetes, Statsd, Grafana, Prometheus)

**Difficulty level:** moderate

**Ideal candidate:** advanced or student level both OK

#### Description

Feast is an open source feature store that enables users to register data sources and features, discover features at training time, and reliably serve features in online systems. Feast uses compute systems (primarily data warehouses) to do large scale joins. Feast also provides the ability for users to stream real-time features into an online store, from which production ML systems read feature values in order to make predictions.

Despite the fact that Feast operates as a production data system for operational machine learning, Feast is still relatively limited in the types of monitoring it allows. Teams that are running Feast at scale need a way to understand how the system is operating. This project seeks to add support for end-to-end monitoring to Feast, which will allow operators of the system to get visibility into component level metrics at ingestion, storage, compute, and retrieval time, as well as data level metrics to understand which features are available within the feature store.

This project aims to add real-time observability into the following milestones:

- RFC for overall design (approved by community + core Feast maintainers)
- Implementation (including tests + documentation + tutorial)
  - Metric collection at the following points using Statsd or equivalent
    - Materialization library (writes to online store)
    - Python/Go Online Servers (reads from online store)
    - Push API (writes to online store)
    - Feature Transformation Server (computes features)
  - Metric sink (StatsD)
  - Configuration of metric collection through feature_store.yaml
  - Create a Helm chart for deployment of the metric stack
- (optional): Build a data visualization dashboard in Grafana to trend metrics in Prometheus
- (optional): Add support for sinking not only performance metrics but also feature values to Prometheus. This allows operators to set alerts based on both metrics and feature values.
- (optional): Add support for updating Prometheus/Grafana configuration based on the feature views in the registry.
- (optional): Make it possible for users to detect anomalies in data by allowing them to configure alerts based on tags in feature views

### Project idea #2: Batch transformations

**Time:** 350 hr = 8 weeks

**Potential Mentors:**

- [Achal Shah](https://github.com/achals)
- [Tsotne Tabidze](https://github.com/tsotnet)
- [Felix Wang](https://github.com/felixwang9817)


**Prerequisites:**

- Python
- SQL
- Nice to have: familiarity with MLOps / ML tooling (Spark, dbt, dagster, Dataflow, Flink, etc)

**Difficulty level:** moderate

**Ideal candidate:** advanced or student level both OK

#### Description

Feast is an open source feature store that enables users to register data sources and features, discover features at training time, and reliably serve features in online systems. Feast uses compute systems (primarily data warehouses) to do large scale joins.

One capability Feast is missing is the ability to support batch transformations (i.e. transforming large amounts of time series data into feature values for generating training data). Many users want a light-weight way to do feature engineering in Feast. Many other users have existing transformation pipelines (that data scientists use), but want to use Feast as a way of encouraging feature / data pipeline re-use.

This project aims to add feature engineering in several milestones:

- RFC for overall design (approved by community + core Feast maintainers)
- Implementation (including tests + documentation + tutorial)
  - SQL based transformation (leveraging the existing data warehouses registered as offline stores) defined as part of a Feast BatchFeatureView that uses the SQL dialect of the underlying offline store
  - Pandas based transformations (using Ray/Dask) for a pythonic transformation
    - e.g. data scientists can easily transition from notebook driven development
  - Integration into Feast Web UI
- (optional): using pandas based batch transformations to execute consistent transformations at training vs serving time (ODFV)
- (optional): allow Spark based transformations (spark_sql vs pyspark)
- (optional): allow dbt based transformations
- (optional): integration with existing transformation pipelines (dbt, Spark, Dataflow)

### Project idea #3: Streaming Compute

**Time:** 350 hr = 8 weeks

**Potential Mentors:**

- [Oleksii Moskalenko](https://github.com/pyalex)
- [Danny Chiao](https://github.com/adchia)
- [Achal Shah](https://github.com/achals)

**Prerequisites:**

- Java or Scala
- Nice to have: familiarity stream processing frameworks (Apache Spark, Apache Beam, Apache Flink)

**Difficulty level:** moderate

**Ideal candidate:** advanced or student level both OK

#### Description

Feast is an open source feature store that enables users to register data sources and features, discover features at training time, and reliably serve features in online systems. Feast uses compute systems (primarily data warehouses) to do large scale joins. Feast also provides the ability for users to stream real-time features into an online store, from which production ML systems read feature values in order to make predictions.

The “streaming” implementation that Feast has today is very limited. It’s simply a push-based API to which users of Feast should write their values. Essentially Feast requires users to launch and manage their own streaming jobs, compute their own feature values based on streaming events, and then push them to Feast through this push API.

The goal of this project is to build a real-time streaming compute stack that makes it possible for users to define streaming feature aggregations, and have this streaming system automatically launch jobs to compute features and write them to the feature store.

This project aims to add real-time observability into the following milestones:

- RFC for overall design (approved by community + core Feast maintainers)
- Implementation (including tests + documentation + tutorial)
  - Develop a streaming job launcher for a single platform (Spark, Flink, Beam, etc)
  - Develop a streaming job orchestrator to ensure jobs are started, stopped, or restarted.
  - Develop feature definitions (feature views) that allow users to define aggregations and register the with Feast
  - Add support for at least a single streaming source (like Kafka)
- (optional) Integrate metric production with the streaming stack
- (optional) Allow users to develop and test streaming jobs from within a local development environment
- (optional) Add support for partial aggregations/tiling, which lets the streaming compute system aggregate feature values partially, while the online serving stack takes care of the complete aggregation

## The Milvus project

- Name: Milvus Vector Database
- Homepage: https://milvus.io/
- GitHub: https://github.com/milvus-io/milvus

Milvus was created in 2019 with a singular goal: store, index, and manage massive embedding vectors generated by deep neural networks and other machine learning (ML) models.

As a database specifically designed to handle queries over input vectors, it is capable of indexing vectors on a trillion scale. Unlike existing relational databases which mainly deal with structured data following a pre-defined pattern, Milvus is designed from the bottom-up to handle embedding vectors converted from unstructured data.

### Project idea #1: Support Range Search in Milvus

#### Abstract

Range search is an operator returning all elements that are within a given radius of the query point. It is another widely used similarity search operator. This project will focus on integrating range search functionality into Milvus.

### Project idea #2: Distributed file system Support for Milvus

#### Abstract

Milvus adopt the design principle of computation storage disaggregation. The primary storage we support is object storage such as Minio && S3. This project will focus on integrating Milvus with HDFS,  and probably other distributed file systems such as Ceph and GlusterFS

| Difficulty | Time | Priority | Mentors|
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | 175 hr | Medium | [Congqi Xia](https://github.com/congqixia) |

#### Technical Details

Milvus already has a good storage abstraction. We can support both local disk and Minio as chunk storage. To support DFS as the storage backend, we will need to:

- Implement DFSChunkManager
- Finish all the unit test and integration test together with distributed file system.
- Add monitoring metrics about IOPs, traffic and latency.
- Design and run the performance benchmark

#### Helpful Experience

- Proficient in Go
- **Nice to have:** have the experience of using distributed storage, familiar with a distributed system.

#### First Steps

- Read the code in Milvus about MinioChunkManager
- Discuss your proposal with the mentors.
- Join our slack channel or mail our mentors to get in touch with them for more information

### Project idea #3: Implement  auto scaler for milvus

#### Abstract

Milvus is a cloud-native vector database and we have good elasticity thanks to the design of storage computation disaggregation. In this project, we want to support a cluster auto scalar which could change the cluster size based on user traffic.

| Difficulty | Time | Priority | Mentors|
|---|---|---|---|
| Moderate | 175 hr | Medium | [Edward Zeng](https://github.com/LoveEachDay), [Xiaofan-luan](https://github.com/xiaofan-luan) |

#### Technical Details

The key to this project is to evaluate the existing open-source auto scalar mechanism and determine which one we could adopt into Milvus. The task owner must have deep knowledge about what metrics can be used as the trigger judgment to expand and shrink the cluster. To implement a stable auto scalar, follow the steps:

- Follow the benchmark of milvus, run stress tests and find the correct metrics that indicate the system load (May need to add actual metrics)
- Implement the logic to collect all the metrics
- Implement the core logic about making operation decision
- Call Milvus K8s operator to expand or shrink the cluster
- Run adequate benchmark tests with various workloads, test if the auto scalar works as expected.

#### Helpful Experience

- Proficient in Go
- Knowledge about K8s
- **Nice to have:** Basic knowledge K8s auto scalar and Knative, familiar with prometheus.

#### First Steps

- Investigate different auto scalars
- Run performance benchmark and interpret all metrics on prometheus cluster
- Design the core logic of resource orchestration
- Discuss your proposal with the mentors.
- Join our slack channel or mail our mentors to get in touch with them for more information

### Project idea #4: Implement dynamic config storage

#### Abstract

Milvus supports yaml style config and it is static. When a user wants to change configuration, the whole cluster needs to be rebooted. This project aims to implement a persistent, dynamic load, and notification mechanism  for cluster configuration.

| Difficulty | Time | Priority | Mentors|
|---|---|---|---|
| Easy | 175 hr | Medium | [Xuan Yang](https://github.com/XuanYang-cn)  |

#### Technical Details

The key part of the project is to implement a config table on meta storage such as Etcd.  We'll need to define storage format, design the notification mechanism and update param table of each component. To finish the task, we will need to:

- Implement config storage on etcd
- Design the notification based on Etcd watch
- Reload logic for each of the configuration items
- Design the proto to set and remove specified configs
- Implementing this API on multi language SDKs
- Integrate the config with Attu - the milvus management GUI (Optional)

#### Helpful Experience

- Proficient in Go
- Knowledge about Etcd
- **Nice to have:** Knowledge of other language , including Cpp, Java, Python

#### First Steps

- Run Milvus and try to tune some of the configs
- Read the code of param table, understand current param load mechanism
- Discuss your proposal with the mentors.
- Join our slack channel or mail our mentors to get in touch with them for more information

### Project idea #5: Support add/remove field in collection schema

#### Abstract

The collection schema in current Milvus design is immutable. User may want to add or drop one of the fields especially when their data is synced from other data sources. We should support  DDL  operations to manage collection fields.

| Difficulty | Time | Priority | Mentors|
|---|---|---|---|
| Hard | 350 hr | Medium | [jaime0815](https://github.com/jaime0815) |

#### Technical Details

To add one field should be fairly simple, the system need to update collection meta on etcd and notify all the query node and proxy that collection meta has been changed. The only trouble is Milvus does not support incomplete entities, thus we will need to implement some default value mechanism to make sure new added field has a return value.

To remove a field is a bit complicated, except for changing collection meta and  notify all components,  Rootcoord is also responsible for cleaning up deleted column data, and one has to  carefully design the clean up process because of time travel, snapshot and other mechanisms.

To finish the task, we will need to:

- Implement collection schema modification logic
- Implement the logic to notify all meta caches
- Implement default value logic for new added field
- Implement the deleted field data purge

#### Helpful Experience

- Proficient in Go
- Knowledge about database schema change
- **Nice to have:** Familiar of the DDL part of any opensource database

#### First Steps

- Setup development environment of Milvus
- Read the code of current collection creation and drop
- Find all usage of collection meta in proxy, data node and query node
- Discuss your proposal with the mentors.
- Join our slack channel or mail our mentors to get in touch with them for more information

## The Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) project

- Name: Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART)
- Homepage: https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.org/
- GitHub: https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox

Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is a Python library for Machine Learning Security. ART provides tools that enable developers and researchers to defend and evaluate Machine Learning models and applications against the adversarial threats of Evasion, Poisoning, Extraction, and Inference.
